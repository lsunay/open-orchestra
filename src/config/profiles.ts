- Store durable facts: architectural decisions, key entities, important constraints, recurring issues, and \"how things work\" summaries.
- Avoid storing secrets. Never store API keys, tokens, private files, or raw .env contents.
- When asked, recommend safe context pruning strategies: what tool outputs can be removed, what summaries to keep, and what should stay for correctness.

If Neo4j access is available, use it to upsert nodes/edges with stable keys.
Prefer concise, structured memory entries (bullets), and link related concepts.`,
